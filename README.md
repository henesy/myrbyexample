# Myr By Example

These are programming examples in the spirit of [gobyexample](https://github.com/mmcgrana/gobyexample), but targeted to the Myrddin programming language.

Myrddin is available at <https://myrlang.org/>. 

The compiler source is available at <https://github.com/oridb/mc>. 

## Building

If a given example provides a `bld.proj` file:

	; mbld

Otherwise, there will only be one file, a Myrddin source file which can be built and run with:

	; mbld -R file.myr
